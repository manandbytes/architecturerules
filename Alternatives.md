> Macker is a build-time architectural rule checking utility for Java developers. It's meant to model the architectural ideals programmers always dream up for their projects, and then break -- it helps keep code clean and consistent. You can tailor a rules file to suit a specific project's structure, or write some general "good practice" rules for your code. Macker doesn't try to shove anybody else's rules down your throat; it's flexible, and writing a rules file is part of the development process for each unique project.

  * [Japan - Java Package Analyser](http://japan.sourceforge.net/)

> Japan is an Ant task and IntelliJ plugin for checking you haven't broken any of the package dependency rules within your Java project. For example, you might want to allow the 'client' and 'server' packages to see 'remote', but not allow 'remote' to see 'client' or 'server'. Japan works on Java source files and the dependency rules are defined in an XML configuration file.
