So far so good. My goal is 80%. I have a few more tests in mind that should get me closer to 85%.

| Package 					| # Classes 	| Line Coverage 	| Branch Coverage 	| Complexity |
|:-------------|:-----------|:---------------|:-----------------|:------------|
| All Packages					| 25	        | 80%                  | 83% 	                | 2.1         |

You can generate the full report by downloading from source then running the Maven2 command `mvn clean site
